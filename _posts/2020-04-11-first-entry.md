Well, this is my first entry. I'm not sure that I will be able to post content regulary. But I will try.
I'm determined to do it.
I'll comment on social things, code I'm working on. I'll try to explain, and make things clear.

Besides that I expect to build a pretty site, with nice images, png content.
I'm gonna be doing this a bit at a time, better every day. Right now I'm struggling with markdown language, because I've never did.

You're welcome to leave any comments. For now you can't leave comments directly on this page.
But you can contact me on twitter, or mail, or github. See my about.

See you on the next posts!! :)
